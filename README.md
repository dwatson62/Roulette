## Synopsis

This is my personal project to practice MEAN JS skills. It is a Roulette game closely modelled on the real life, using play money. Once the game is up and running, I will also use it to learn more about CSS and styling.

Currently players can bet once per spin, on a number, colour or odd/even. Can also view past spins for that particular session.
