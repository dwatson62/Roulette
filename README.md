## Synopsis

This is my personal project to practice MEAN JS skills. It is a Roulette game closely modelled on the real life, using play money. Once the game is up and running, I will also use it to learn more about CSS and styling.

Currently players can bet multiple amounts on different on different numbers, colours, odd/even, streets and columns. Can also view past spins for that particular session, and repeat the previous bet.
